        When a seed of a plant or tree grow it makes the area around it greener.
        Also, it supports many life forms. Birds make their nests, many reptiles
        and animals live on it or near it. Besides, all these many beautiful
        flowers, food growing on it. Moreover, many parts of trees such as
        roots, leaves, stem, flower, seeds, are also edible. Most importantly
        they never ask anything in return for their services and the gifts they
        give. Trees also keep the balance in the ecosystem and ecology. To
        conclude, we can say that trees are very important and beneficial for
        every life form on earth. Without them, the survival of life on earth
        will become difficult and after some time every species starts to die
        because of lack of oxygen on the planet. So, to save our lives and to
        survive we have to learn the importance of trees and also have to teach
        our children the importance of trees.

        Everything we see around us constitutes nature, including the sun, the
        moon, trees, flowers, fruits, human beings, birds, animals, etc. In
        nature, everyone depends on one another to keep the ecosystem healthy.
        For survival, every creature is interrelated and reliant on one another.
        Humans, for example, rely on nature for their survival, and nature
        provides us with oxygen, food, water, shelter, medicines, and clothing,
        among other things. Many shades may be seen in nature, contributing to
        the planet’s beauty. Along with humans, animals and birds also find
        their habitat and means of survival in nature. Therefore, it is
        essential to take proper care of our nature to maintain a healthy life.

        My friend could hardly speak but managed to get the words out that her
        daughter, 28, had died that morning of a drug overdose. She had just
        heard the news. It was a call that I had somehow always expected I might
        get, and yet it nearly took me to my knees. Her daughter had struggled
        with addiction mightily for 12 years. She was bright, beautiful, married
        and a mother to an adorable three-year-old. This was a girl who my own
        two sons thought of as a cousin. She loved Leelanau and came up every
        summer with her mom and younger brother, to stay with us for a week. I
        can still see her jumping off our raft, or surfing the waves at Van’s
        Beach, or toasting marshmallows by firelight, her long dark hair pulled
        back.
